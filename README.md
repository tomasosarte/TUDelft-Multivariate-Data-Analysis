# Multivariate Data Analysis

Welcome to the Advanced Probability and Statistics Course repository! This repository contains materials and exercises for a comprehensive course covering fundamental concepts in probability theory, stochastic processes, and advanced statistical techniques. The course is designed for students with a background in electrical and computer engineering, as well as related fields such as computer science.

## Course Overview

This course is divided into two parts:

### Part I: Probability Theory and Stochastic Processes

In Part I, we delve into the foundations of probability theory and stochastic processes, focusing on essential topics such as random variables, correlation functions, random processes, and signal processing. Practical exercises using MATLAB are integrated throughout the course to reinforce theoretical concepts.

#### Topics Covered:
1. Random Variables and Probability Distributions
2. Correlation Functions and Random Processes
3. Random Signal Processing and Power Spectral Density
4. Autoregressive Processes and Linear Prediction
5. Markov Chains

### Part II: Advanced Statistics and Machine Learning

Part II extends the statistical foundation by exploring linear models, Bayesian inference, classification problems, Gaussian processes, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. The emphasis is on practical applications in engineering contexts.

#### Topics Covered:
1. Linear Models and Bayesian Inference
2. Classification Problems and Gaussian Processes
3. Markov Chain Monte Carlo Methods
4. Hyperparameter Optimization and Posterior Approximation

## Learning Objectives
